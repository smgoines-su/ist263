    <h1>Steven Goines's Biography</h1>
   <p>
    My name is Steven Goines. My current major is Undecided in the <strong>Arts and Sciences College</strong>  but I plan on transferring to the iSchool next semester for Information management and technology. I am skilled in many assets such as graphic design, and I even have a professional certificate for the popular editing application Adobe Premiere Pro.

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
    In my free time I like to exercise, watch sports such as basketball, football, and MMA, and hang out with my friends. My favorite movie is Wolf of Wall Street and even though I am not a big fan of reading I always can enjoy a great motivational book.
